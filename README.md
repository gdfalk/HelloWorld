## Hello World

### by Graham Falk

Writes "Hello World!" on screen with color. WOW

Moves "Hello World!" with white, red, and black on the screen from top left to bottom right in a probably very inefficient way.
On mouse click, it resets the "Hello World!" to the top left and randomizes the color of the background between 5 preset colors.
